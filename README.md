Extract all the files but make sure to keep them in their corresponding folder.
To run the project:
First, install the dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main.py file, which will output a local address where the web application is running on. That looks like: http://127.0.0.1:5000
Click on that link, or paste it in your preferred web browser like chrome or firefox.
If the setup was done correctly, the project should be running on that site.

Alternatively, the site is hosted on this web address:  http://laudo.pythonanywhere.com/
