"0,2 or 3 Things I Know About Her,""In2 or 3 Things I Know About Her(2 ou 3 choses que je sais d’elle), Jean-Luc Godard beckons us ever closer, whispering in our ears as narrator. About what? Money, sex, fashion, the city, love, language, war: in a word, everything. Among the legendary French filmmaker’s finest achievements, the film takes as its ostensible subject the daily life of Juliette Janson (Marina Vlady), a housewife from the Paris suburbs who prostitutes herself for extra money. Yet this is only a template for Godard to spin off into provocative philosophical tangents and gorgeous images.2 or 3 Things I Know About Heris perhaps Godard’s most revelatory look at consumer culture, shot in ravishing widescreen color by Raoul Coutard."",Jean-Luc Godard,France,1967,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2d01c1355a26b42297d80a960899c4f5/93Btri2IgKEjkVfyjMctarS9VtARHo_large.jpg"
"1,3:10 to Yuma,""In this beautifully shot, psychologically complex western, Van Heflin is a mild-mannered cattle rancher who takes on the task of shepherding a captured outlaw (played with cucumber-cool charisma by Glenn Ford) to the train that will deliver him to prison. This apparently simple mission turns into a nerve-racking cat-and-mouse game that tests each man’s particular brand of honor. Based on a story by Elmore Leonard,3:10 to Yumais a thrilling, humane action movie, directed by the supremely talented studio filmmaker Delmer Daves with intense feeling and precision."",Delmer Daves,United States,1957,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/ab1d9b806f1efe28878526241f632b9a/Zm61wXSmEUBWzzoMzmJOGYPvQ8Cg5v_large.jpg"
"2,3 Women,""In a dusty, underpopulated California resort town, a naive southern waif, Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek), idolizes and befriends her fellow nurse, the would-be sophisticate and “thoroughly modern” Millie Lammoreaux (Shelley Duvall). When Millie takes Pinky in as her roommate, Pinky’s hero worship evolves into something far stranger and more sinister than either could have anticipated. Featuring brilliant performances from Spacek and Duvall, this dreamlike masterpiece from Robert Altman careens from the humorous to the chilling to the surreal, resulting in one of the most unusual and compelling films of the 1970s."",Robert Altman,United States,1977,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/75466150cfc0b49b10f051e0c239f3fc/1rrp8R9m37AAxe9ctq9TFKwyYOQ8jW_large.jpg"
"3,""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"",""Romanian filmmaker Cristian Mungiu shot to international prominence with this rigorously realistic Palme d’Or–winning second feature. In 1987, during the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu, college roommates Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) and Găbița (Laura Vasiliu) seek an illegal abortion for Găbița. In unflinching but empathetic detail, the film recounts the events of twenty-four perilous hours in their lives, culminating in their encounter with a manipulative and menacing abortionist (Vlad Ivanov). With powerful performances that accentuate the characters’ flawed humanity,4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Daysis a gutting account of the impossible choices women face when taking control of their bodies means breaking the law."",Cristian Mungiu,Romania,2007,Romanian,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/65395fe8adf90ac719ea54fb460176fa/l2Q2n24ks84HZnVyuZvxqzIJk55lgR_large.jpg"
"4,8½,""Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, a director whose new project is collapsing around him, along with his life. One of the greatest films about film ever made, Federico Fellini’s8½(Otto e mezzo) turns one man’s artistic crisis into a grand epic of the cinema.

"5,12 Angry Men,""12 Angry Men,by Sidney Lumet, may be the most radical courtroom drama in cinema history. A behind-closed-doors look at the American legal system that is as riveting as it is spare, this iconic adaptation of Reginald Rose’s teleplay stars Henry Fonda as the dissenting member on a jury of white men ready to pass judgment on a Puerto Rican teenager charged with murdering his father. The result is a saga of epic proportions that plays out over a tense afternoon in one sweltering room. Lumet’s electrifying snapshot of 1950s America on the verge of change is one of the great feature film debuts."",Sidney Lumet,United States,1957,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/b64d8d6785c12ae24b029f8b625c3c1a/PMLyOniHrRG3nyansZSwJxghltbxsC_large.jpg"
"6,24 Frames,""For what would prove to be his final film, Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami gave himself a challenge: to create a dialogue between his work as a filmmaker and his work as a photographer, bridging the two art forms to which he had dedicated his life. Setting out to reconstruct the moments immediately before and after a photograph is taken, Kiarostami selected twenty-four still images—most of them stark landscapes inhabited only by foraging birds and other wildlife—and digitally animated each one into its own subtly evolving four-and-a-half-minute vignette, creating a series of poignant studies in movement, perception, and time. A sustained meditation on the process of image making,24 Framesis a graceful and elegiac farewell from one of the giants of world cinema."",Abbas Kiarostami,Iran,2017,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/22cc8506c3dcd5e77e2d68c09b5f288b/lbWguDGRXPyIVW9oJ1BLa2f1GSAG10_large.jpg"
"7,The 39 Steps,""A heart-racing spy story by Alfred Hitchcock,The 39 Stepsfollows Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) as he stumbles upon a conspiracy that thrusts him into a hectic chase across the Scottish moors—a chase in which he is both the pursuer and the pursued—as well as into an unexpected romance with the cool Pamela (Madeline Carroll). Adapted from a novel by John Buchan, this classic wrong-man thriller from the Master of Suspense anticipates the director’s most famous works (especiallyNorth by Northwest), and remains one of his cleverest and most entertaining films."",Alfred Hitchcock,United Kingdom,1935,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/aacbf709cba74e607ae657b7ea6ff1cf/2jsGvFmN8GvcK82SeP32fOu0YpUx1i_large.jpg"
"8,45 Years,""In this exquisitely calibrated film, Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay perform a subtly off-kilter pas de deux as Kate and Geoff, an English couple who, on the eve of an anniversary celebration, find their long marriage shaken by the arrival of a letter to Geoff that unceremoniously collapses his past into their shared present. Director Andrew Haigh carries the tradition of British realist cinema to artful new heights in45 Years,weaving the momentous into the mundane as the pair go about their daily lives, while the evocatively flat, wintry Norfolk landscape frames their struggle to maintain an increasingly untenable status quo. Loosely adapting a short story by David Constantine, Haigh shifts the focus from the slightly erratic Geoff to Kate, eliciting a remarkable, nuanced portrayal by Rampling of a woman’s gradual metamorphosis from unflappable wife to woman undone."",Andrew Haigh,United Kingdom,2015,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/30b643cfea431b3b50606249f145a888/RFDmoYxUdM1EcSWfagb3bhMvnINOWF_large.jpg"
"9,49th Parallel,""At once a compelling piece of anti-isolationist propaganda and a quick-witted wartime thriller,49th Parallelis a classic early work from the inimitable British filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. When a Nazi U-boat crew, headed by the ruthless Eric Portman, is stranded in Canada during the thick of World War II, the men evade capture by hiding out in a series of rural communities, before trying to cross the border into the still-neutral United States. Both soul-stirring and delightfully entertaining,49th Parallelfeatures a colorful cast of characters played by larger-than-life actors Laurence Olivier, Raymond Massey, Anton Walbrook, and Leslie Howard."",Michael Powell,United Kingdom,1941,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/da2032b3d3115969152fd4f442094cbd/yunzkLos81PnuwixO24PC6ZH8Nc4vM_large.jpg"
"10,100 Years of Olympic Films: 1912–2012,""Spanning fifty-three movies and forty-one editions of the Olympic Games,100 Years of Olympic Films: 1912–2012is the culmination of a monumental, award-winning archival project encompassing dozens of new restorations by the International Olympic Committee. The documentaries collected here cast a cinematic eye on some of the most iconic moments in the history of modern sports, spotlighting athletes who embody the Olympic motto of “Faster, Higher, Stronger”: Jesse Owens shattering world records on the track in 1936 Berlin, Jean-Claude Killy dominating the Grenoble slopes in 1968, Joan Benoit breaking away to win the Games’ first women’s marathon in Los Angeles in 1984. In addition to the impressive ten-feature contribution of Bud Greenspan, this stirring collective chronicle of triumph and defeat includes such documentary landmarks as Leni Riefenstahl’sOlympiaand Kon Ichikawa’sTokyo Olympiad,along with captivating lesser-known works by major directors like Claude Lelouch, Carlos Saura, and Miloš Forman. It also offers a fascinating glimpse of the development of film itself, and of the technological progress that has brought viewers ever closer to the action. Traversing continents and decades, reflecting the social, cultural, and political changes that have shaped our recent history, this remarkable movie marathon showcases a hundred years of human endeavor."",,,0,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/51412a295670524ffce1299968c379fd/Okb9pCnEQmV0faxMB7JmLrUTJQrvxx_large.jpg"
"11,The 400 Blows,""François Truffaut’s first feature is also his most personal. Told from the point of view of Truffaut’s cinematic counterpart, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud),The 400 Blows(Les quatre cents coups) sensitively re-creates the trials of Truffaut’s own childhood, unsentimentally portraying aloof parents, oppressive teachers, and petty crime. The film marked Truffaut’s passage from leading critic to trailblazing auteur of the French New Wave."",François Truffaut,France,1959,French,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/6419fdfbf3442b70b449e2780ae6ac04/Jli0DzbsLXV9c4V1sPirW4n2Lw5FR8_large.jpg"
"12,1984,""This masterly adaptation of George Orwell’s chilling parable about totalitarian oppression gives harrowing cinematic expression to the book’s prophetic dystopia. In a rubble-strewn surveillance state where an endless overseas war props up the repressive regime of the all-seeing Big Brother, and all dissent is promptly squashed, a profoundly alienated citizen, Winston Smith (thrillingly played by John Hurt), risks everything for an illicit affair with the rebellious Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), defiantly asserting his humanity in the face of soul-crushing conformity. Through vividly grim production design and expressionistically desaturated cinematography by Roger Deakins, Michael Radford’s1984conjures a bleak vision of postwar Britain as fascistic nightmare—a world all too recognizable as our own."",Michael Radford,United Kingdom,1984,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/9b263f6358cf0bae18244c759d4592f0/BonyZ4taymxrfBiRqY6K42NBh0jsop_large.jpg"
"13,Ace in the Hole,""Billy Wilder’sAce in the Holeis one of the most scathing indictments of American culture ever produced by a Hollywood filmmaker. Kirk Douglas gives the fiercest performance of his career as Chuck Tatum, an amoral newspaper reporter who washes up in dead-end Albuquerque, happens upon the scoop of a lifetime, and will do anything to keep getting the lurid headlines. Wilder’s follow-up toSunset Boulevardis an even darker vision, a no-holds-barred exposé of the American media’s appetite for sensation that has gotten only more relevant with time."",Billy Wilder,United States,1951,English,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/2fe2ca53e58aeac665d09fae9748347f/3oBi9k9iUQzTspeg9nyJiO6UF2bPLA_large.jpg"
"14,An Actor’s Revenge,""A uniquely prolific and chameleonic figure of world cinema, Kon Ichikawa delivered a burst of stylistic bravado with this intricate tale of betrayal and retribution. Set in the cloistered world of nineteenth-century kabuki theater, the film charts a female impersonator’s attempts to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were driven to insanity and suicide by a trio of corrupt men. Ichikawa takes the conventions of melodrama and turns them on their head, bringing the hero’s fractured psyche to life in boldly experimental widescreen compositions infused with kaleidoscopic color, pop-art influences, and meticulous choreography. Anchored by a magnificently androgynous performance by Kazuo Hasegawa, reprising a role he had played on-screen three decades earlier,An Actor’s Revengeis an eye-popping examination of how the illusions of art intersect with life."",Kon Ichikawa,Japan,1963,Japanese,https://s3.amazonaws.com/criterion-production/films/4b189bbc4839b45ecfee6d8546d303e6/KaW2t9UP1dYbpFxJDSlXEbSApZ8SaV_large.jpg"
